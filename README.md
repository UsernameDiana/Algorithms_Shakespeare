# Sorting in Shakespeare
We used Selection sort, Merge sort and Insertion sort algorithms to sort an array of complete Shakespeare work, sorted by word.
To see how long the different algorithms sort, we messured time.

# Searching in Shakespeare
We saved the words of complete Shakespears work in a Symbol table. The words are keys and the values are the numbers of occurence in the text. Here we used different implementations of Symbol table: 

Linked Symbol Table, using a linked list-based Symbol table.

Array Symbol Table, using an array-based Symbol table and Flexible Array class.

Hashed Symbol Table useng hashing strategy.

Balanced Tree Symbol Table using balanced tree as red-black
